# Cryptocurrency Project
C++ cryptocurrency/block-chain. Mostly basic blockchain for now. New Additions are in the works(see below).<br>
*This file details what this repository includes, and what is planned for the future.*

### Inclusions
* **A Basic Blockchain**
* **Wallets that store addresses**
* **addWallet() command that can be run to add a wallet to that blockchain**

### Future Additions
* **Wallet Passwords**
* **Basic Sharding System** - to break up the block into managable pieces for the next addition
* **A Proper Verification System** - send to many verifiers on the blockchain to avoid security risks
* **A Proper Private Transaction System** - Inspired by Monero (this will hide the senderAddress and receiverAddress, resulting in the lack of ability for the currency to be traced)
* **Proof of Stake System** - Just think of the amount of electricity Bitcoin miners use... Let's not do that ;)
* **DeFi 2.0!!**
